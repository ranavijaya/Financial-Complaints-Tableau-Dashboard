Overview of this #visualization:

KPIs are placed at the top of the dashboard, to easily view the figures associated with 'Total Complaints', 'Timely Response', 'Complaints In Progress', 'Disputed Rate', and 'Resolved at No Cost'.
Complaints are segmented by 'Issue', 'States', 'Media', and 'Product'. For States, a ‘hex map’ is used, while for Media, a ‘Lollipop’ chart is used.
A ‘Donut’ Chart is used to show the percentage of disputed customers.
I received inspiration for the 'Hex Tile Maps' from 'Sir Viz-a-lot' blogs by "Matt Chambers, MBA".
The "Real World Fake Data" dataset used in this project is accessible on the 'data.world' website. This dataset is based on real-world data and is used to practice real-world problems.
